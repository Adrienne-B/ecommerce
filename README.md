# ecommerce
 A fully functional e-commerce app using Spring Boot.

## Summary
All that we have learn in TTS in regards to Eclipse(java) we had to be in two separate groups, work together to create a ecommerce website project.

### Software used:
Eclipse(java)-Spring Boot

### What I learn:
1. Make sure words are the same when.
2. Make sure to get the correct imports.
3. Make sure your eCommerce application is selected when you make the environment variable and insert correct API keys
4. There's an API specifically for credit card transation

#### Challenges to improve on:
N/A 

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. Trying to run the application. 
2. Couldn't open a teammate's folder that was downloaded to be in my local.

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. To run the project go to Pom and commit out line 8 (data infor), hit save, run it, then uncommit data info, save, then run. 
    Sometimes you have to add a variable such as a new number if the data didnt process successfully for it to load on the browser.
    
2. Create a new workspace which should be able to open someone's folder
    
3. TeamWork :)


#### Weakness so far:
1.	Eclipse(java) specifically Spring Boot, is still something I need to work on.
